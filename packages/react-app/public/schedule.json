DApps are deployed as stand-alone apps in each L2 with limited ability to communicate with each other. This leads to silos and several issues in terms of capital efficiency, governance, security, user experience and maintenance.\r\nWe will explore how bridges should become the interoperability layer that will connect all the protocol \u201csilos\u201d across L2s, by using secure message passing.",

Nosy is a very annoying (to the devs) tool that aims to find bugs the moment they are introduced. Leveraging the go/types and go/parser libraries used by the Go compiler, Nosy analyzes the AST of a repo and generates fuzz harnesses for continuous fuzzing\r\n\r\nCome learn about Nosy's novel approach to go-fuzzing and the issues it has uncovered!",

To achieve this vision, he has been working on scaling R&D to make the core protocol more secure and accessible to everyone. This includes tooling and testing work for the Merge, exploratory prototyping for sharding work like EIP-4844 and EIP-4895 to enable validator withdrawals after the Merge. When he is not working on Ethereum, you can find him at the nearest mountaintop.",

Here we want to show you how you as a developer or auditor can apply fairly simple mathematical thinking to make your code more robust and your security work simpler. By thinking \u201cinvariants first\u201d you can get stronger tests, better docs, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs in your future coding.",

They are meant to hold liquidity, asked to operate quickly, but they cannot benefit from the security guarantees of an on-chain application, because they inherently contain off-chain components. In this talk, we discuss the properties of a bridge that is secure and meets all the needs for it to be useful.",

Some apps provide basic private functionality for a single private state (e.g. privacy coins).\r\nWe'll discuss ways to execute general private and public state changes across multiple smart contracts in one transaction, within a zk-rollup.

It attempts to minimise negative effects of MEV by delegating block building to a market of block builders. This talk would cover what we have learned from the rollout of mev-boost, focusing on what is happening in the builder market, and what this means for the future of in-protocol PBS. What are the main improvements that we can make to the PBS design in response to how this prototype version is performing?",

We first introduce a new analytical tool, the *redemption curve*, which represents the redemption price as a function of redemption pressure. We use it to discuss historical de-peggings (e.g. in DAI, UST). We then describe a new dynamic redemption curve with desirable robustness properties and show how to implement a primary market based on this curve. The system is part of Gyroscope.",

Finally, we outline the open research challenges across these security types.",

Inspired by ThoughtWorks, we decided to map all these Web3 technologies, present them using a radar metaphor, and give them as a public good. This initiative helps developers understand ecosystems and technology stacks in the Web3 universe. It further allows them to create their radars. This talk will introduce this methodology framework to help tech teams make better decisions.",

Echidna has been used in many professional audits, and fuzzing is a key component to increasing the contracts\u2019 security. Attendees will learn how to define and write invariants and how to use Echidna efficiently. By the end of the session, they will know how to integrate property testing into their development process and write more secure code.",
